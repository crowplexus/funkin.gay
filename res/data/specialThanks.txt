and there's SO MANY other people.

you all, in some way, contributed to my current hyperfixation with this game
not only that, but also inspired me to be better, to do better, to improve on my skills
and most of all, to learn to love myself, and be happy with the things I create,
even if they don't seem to have any value whatsoever from my perspective
